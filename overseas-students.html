                International students are studying abroad with their
                expectations of living in a foreign country. Their life is full
                of curiosity and beauty. They have expanded their
                horizon and studied more advanced professional
                knowledge. Facing huge challenges posed by new
                environment, different culture and language differences,
                they are positive, optimistic and aspirant. They quickly
                adapt to studying and living in China and make many
                Chinese friends.
